# ng2-mean

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) on client side.

## Development server
Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Server will be running on port 9000 connected to client using proxy service. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the client. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build. Then run `node server` to start running the project with `NODE_ENV=production` for production build. 

## Running unit tests on server

Run `gulp` to execute the unit tests via [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/).

## Running end-to-end tests on client

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.
